High-speed and low-latency wireless communication links will allow municipalities to warn vehicles against safety hazards, as well as support cloud-driving solutions to drastically reduce traffic jams and air pollution. To achieve these goals, vehicles need to be equipped with a wide range of sensors generating and exchanging high rate row-data streams. Recently, millimeter wave (mmWave) techniques have been introduced as a means of fulfilling such high data rate requirements. In this tutorial, we will show how to model a highway communication network and characterize its fundamental link budget metrics. To evaluate our highway network, we will refer to a new theoretical model that accounts for a typical scenario where heavy vehicles (such as buses and lorries) in slow lanes obstruct Line-of-Sight (LOS) paths of vehicles in fast lanes and, hence, act as blockages. Our analysis will provide new design insights for mmWave highway communication networks. In particular, we will show that smaller antenna beamwidths and, unlike bi-dimensional mmWave cellular networks, smaller BS densities do not necessarily have a disruptive impact on improving the SINR outage probability, and consequently the rate coverage probability.</p>

The SDR platform emulates a realistic system in a controlled and real-time environment, capable of interacting with external elements, such as commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) devices and testing equipments, and allowing validation and performance evaluation of novel approaches and technologies, including cloud RANs, application of SDN principles, massive MIMO and full-duplex communications. In this talk, we will cover the main aspects of OAI, and illustrate how to set up and operate a small-scale 3GPP LTE network consisting of emulated RAN and EPC entities providing connectivity to a COTS UE.</p>

This talk refers to a cellular system transmitting layered multicast services to a Multicast Group (MG) of users. Reliability of communications is ensured via different Random Linear Network Coding (RLNC) techniques. We deal with a fundamental problem: the computational complexity of the RLNC decoder. The higher the number of decoding operations is, the more the user's computational overhead grows and, consequently, the faster the batteries of mobile devices drain. By referring to several sparse RLNC techniques, and without any assumption on the implementation of the RLNC decoder in use, we provide an efficient way to characterize the performance of users targeted by ultra-reliable layered multicast services. The proposed modeling allows to efficiently derive the average number of coded packet transmissions needed to recover one or more service layers. We design a convex resource allocation framework that allows to minimize the complexity of the RLNC decoder by jointly optimizing the transmission parameters and the sparsity of the code. The designed optimization framework also ensures service guarantees to predetermined fractions of users. Performance of the proposed optimization framework is then investigated in a LTE-A eMBMS network multicasting H.264/SVC video.</p>

Multi-rate transmission strategies have been proposed as a means of delivering layered services to users experiencing different downlink channel conditions. In this presentation, we consider multiple Unequal Error Protection implementations of the Network Coding strategy for their inherent reliability features. In addition, we formulate resource allocation frameworks which are capable of jointly optimizing both the NC scheme in use and the system transmission parameters. Our proposed frameworks are adapted to the LTE stack and the integrated eMBMS technology. Furthermore, we establish that the choice of the NC technique and the way we define a resource allocation model, play a critical role in the radio resource footprint associated with a multimedia service.</p>

                                                        various network parameters, contributing to the understanding of network dynamics and assisting in the system-level
